CMake build system
==================

Modules are libraries and binaries. A project consists of several libraries and
binaries.

For your project, create a top level CMakeLists.txt, containing at least the
following, assuming that your libraries are defined in 'libraries' and your
binaries are in 'binaries':

  include(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/include/define_module.cmake)

  add_subdirectory(libraries)
  add_subdirectory(binaries)

For a module, simply add a line like

  define_module(
      <name of module>
      [BINARY|LIBRARY]
      [SOURCES <source files>]
      [INCLUDES <other modules>]
      [LINKS <other modules and 3rd parties>])

to the respective CMakeLists.txt. If not specified, the default is to generate
a BINARY module from all *.cpp files in the directory and subdirectories.
